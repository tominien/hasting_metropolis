# The Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm and the Travelling Salesman Problem

This repository contains an undergraduate technical report and accompanying code on the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm and its application to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).  
The work was carried out as part of the "Projet de la licence de Mathématiques" course in the MIDL double-major programme (Mathematics and Computer Science) at the University of Toulouse - Paul Sabatier.

## Project overview

This project had two main goals:

**1. A theoretical study of Markov chains and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm :**
   - Definitions and basic properties of Markov chains (transition matrices, communicating classes, recurrence, ergodicity, invariant distributions).
   - Construction of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as a Markov chain with a prescribed invariant distribution.
   - Proofs of key properties such as reversibility and convergence under suitable conditions.

**2. A practical implementation :**
   - Python implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
   - Sampling from various target distributions (Gaussian, mixtures, discrete laws, etc.).
   - Application to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).
